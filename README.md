# C++ Module 00: Namespaces, Classes, Member Functions, stdio streams, and Initialization Lists

This module is the first step into the world of C++ and object-oriented programming. It covers the fundamental concepts that will be built upon in the subsequent modules.

## Key Concepts

### Namespaces

Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions. The `std` namespace is the most common one, containing the standard C++ library.

### Classes and Objects

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (member functions) that the objects of the class will have. An object is an instance of a class.

### Member Functions

Member functions are functions that are part of a class. They can access and modify the data members of the class.

### stdio streams

The C++ standard library provides a set of classes for input and output operations. The most common ones are `std::cin` for input and `std::cout` for output.

### Initialization Lists

Initialization lists are used to initialize the data members of a class in the constructor. This is the preferred way to initialize members, as it is more efficient than assigning values in the constructor's body.

## Exercises

### Exercise 00: Megaphone

This exercise is a simple program that takes a string as input and prints it to the standard output in uppercase. It is designed to get you familiar with basic input/output operations and string manipulation.

### Exercise 01: PhoneBook

This exercise requires you to create a simple phonebook application. You will need to create a `Contact` class to store contact information and a `PhoneBook` class to manage the contacts. This exercise will help you practice creating classes, objects, and managing memory.
